- Description: <br>
	This is a real time ray tracer project. Currently, it is at the alpha phase, so some features are still under construction, but in the same time it's both the open source and free software. So, one can use and test it right now.
	+ [Here are some use cases.](@ref usecase)
	+ Clone this to get the source code: [https://github.com/Ceitnot/rTTracer.git](https://github.com/Ceitnot/rTTracer.git) 
- Features:
	+ Geometry rendering ( Spheres, Planes, Cubes, Triangle Meshes).
	+ Smooth/flat shading.
	+ Phong shading model.
	+ Reflection surfaces rendering.
	+ Acceleration structure: Kay and Kajiya.
	+ Procedural texturing.
	+ Heterogeneous architeture.
	+ Parallel computation for each pixel.
- Hardware requirements:
	+ Recommended:
		- CUDA copatible videocard with 5.0 cmputation capabilities or higher.
- Software requirements:
	+ Recomended:
		- Proprietary videodriver.
		- CUDA Toolkit 6.5 or higher.
		- Bash interpreter for demo compilation.
- Under development:
	+ Anti-aliasing.
	+ Rendering of complex geometry (bezier curves objects, blobs etc)
	+ Animation recording.
	+ Images export.
